% INPUT:
% a: (p+1)-by-1 vector, estimated parameters of AR model 
%    [ p = length(y0), see below]
% ordering of vector *a* is such that: 
%   a(1) = a_0 [ from Eq. (2) in this Task description ]
%   a(2) = a_1 [ from Eq. (2) in this Task description ]
%   .
%   .
%   a(p+1) = a_p [ from Eq. (2) in this Task description ]
%
% y0: p-by-1 vector, beginning of sequence to be predicted 
%
% N: required length of predicted sequence, including the 
%    beginning represented by y0. 
%
% OUTPUT: 
% y: N-by-1 vector, the predicted sequence y.

% computes the rest of elements of y, starting from (p+1)-th
% one up to N-th one.
